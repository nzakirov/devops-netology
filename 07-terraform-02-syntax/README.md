#  1. (Вариант с Yandex.Cloud) 

Регистрация в ЯО была успешна произведена в предыдущих практических заданиях.

Для того,  что бы не указывать авторизационный токен и другие приватные данные в коде применил подход через экспорт переменных:

```
❯ export TF_VAR_yandex_token=`yc iam create-token`
❯ export TF_VAR_yandex_cloud_id=`yc config get cloud-id`
❯ export TF_VAR_yandex_folder_id=`yc config get folder-id`
```

#  2. (Вариант с Yandex.Cloud) 

```
❯ terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of yandex-cloud/yandex...
- Installing yandex-cloud/yandex v0.76.0...
- Installed yandex-cloud/yandex v0.76.0 (unauthenticated)

Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
you run "terraform init" in the future.

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

**При помощи какого инструмента (из разобранных на прошлом занятии) можно создать свой образ ami?**

- При помощи packer.
